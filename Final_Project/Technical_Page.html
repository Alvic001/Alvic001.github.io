         <p><span>Github</span> is like a big playground for coding projects. It's a website where people can store and share their code with others. Think of it as a place where you can keep track of changes you make to your code, collaborate with others on projects, and even showcase your work to the world. It's super handy for teamwork and making sure everyone's on the same page when working on a project together.</p>

    <section id="HTML" class="main-section">
        <header>HTML</header>
         <p><span>HTML</span> is like the skeleton of a webpage. It's a simple language that web browsers understand. With HTML, you can structure your webpage by adding different elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and links. Think of it as the blueprint that tells your browser how to display content on a webpage. It's the basic building block for creating websites on the internet.</p>
         <p>HTML code example: *</p>
           <code> -!DOCTYPE - html declares the document type and version of HTML being used.<br>
           - html - is the root element of the HTML document.<br>
           - head - contains meta-information about the HTML document, like the title.<br>
           - title - sets the title of the webpage displayed in the browser tab.<br>
           - body - contains the visible content of the webpage.<br>
           - h1 - is a heading element.<br>
           - p - is a paragraph element.<br>
           - img - embeds an image into the webpage, with the src attribute specifying the image URL</code>

    <section id="CSS" class="main-section">
        <header>CSS</header>
         <p><span>CSS</span> is like the stylist of a webpage. It stands for Cascading Style Sheets. With CSS, you can make your webpage look pretty by adding colors, fonts, spacing, and more. Think of it as the decorator that enhances the appearance of your HTML elements. It helps you control how your webpage looks and feels to the users who visit it.</p>
         <p>example: *</p>
           <code> With CSS, you can make your webpages look really cool! You can change colors, fonts, sizes, and even the layout of your webpage. Imagine you have a plain webpage with just text and pictures. CSS lets you style the text with different colors and fonts, make the pictures bigger or smaller, and arrange everything in a neat way. It's like giving your webpage a makeover to make it stand out and look awesome! </code>

    <section id="WSL" class="main-section">
        <header>WSL</header>
         <p><span>WSL</span> is like having a secret passage on your Windows computer that leads to the world of Linux. It lets you run Linux programs and use Linux commands directly within Windows, almost like having two operating systems in one computer. With WSL, you can do things like run Linux software, use terminal commands, and even develop software using tools that are typically found in Linux environments, all without having to switch between different operating systems. It's like having the best of both worlds!</p>
